                <p>Hello! My name is Mary Catherine Kelley - I go by Mary Catherine.</p>
                
                <p>I live in Atlanta, GA, and graduated from the University of Georgia with a BS in Psychology, a BA in
                    Cognitive Science, and a Minor in Anthropology.
                </p>
                
                <p>I’m interested in the human experience as a whole. 
                    Essentially, “Why do people do what they do?”
                </p>
                <p>Since graduating from college, I’ve been trying to figure out what kind of career would allow me to apply
                    the knowledge and skills I learned at UGA, but would also allow me to explore my interest in people. This
                    year, one of my friends mentioned in passing that I might be interested in what she does, UX/UI. I
                    researched the field and realized that UX aligns with my interest in the complex nature of people. We both
                    want to figure out why people do what they do.
                </p>
                <p>Now, I'm finishing a certificate in UX/UI at Georgia Tech, and as a burgeoning UX designer, I
                    hope to continue exploring why people do what they do in relation to technology. 
                </p>
